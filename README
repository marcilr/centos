  CentOS (/ˈsɛntɒs/, from Community Enterprise Operating System) is a
  Linux distribution that provides a free, enterprise-class,
  community-supported computing platform functionally compatible with
  its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).[5][6] In
  January 2014, CentOS announced the official joining with Red Hat
  while staying independent from RHEL,[7] under a new CentOS governing
  board.[8][9]

  The first CentOS release in May 2004, numbered as CentOS version 2,
  was forked from RHEL version 2.1AS.[1] Since the release of version 7.0,
  CentOS officially supports only the x86-64 architecture, while versions
  older than 7.0-1406 also support IA-32 with Physical Address Extension
  (PAE).  As of December 2015, AltArch releases of CentOS 7 are available
  for the IA-32 architecture, Power architecture, and for the ARMv7hl and
  AArch64 variants of the ARM architecture.[10][11]

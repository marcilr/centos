CentOS (/ˈsɛntɒs/, from Community Enterprise Operating System) is a
Linux distribution that provides a free, enterprise-class,
community-supported computing platform functionally compatible with
its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).[5][6] In
January 2014, CentOS announced the official joining with Red Hat
while staying independent from RHEL,[7] under a new CentOS governing
board.[8][9]

The first CentOS release in May 2004, numbered as CentOS version 2,
was forked from RHEL version 2.1AS.[1] Since the release of version 7.0,
CentOS officially supports only the x86-64 architecture, while versions
older than 7.0-1406 also support IA-32 with Physical Address Extension
(PAE).  As of December 2015, AltArch releases of CentOS 7 are available
for the IA-32 architecture, Power architecture, and for the ARMv7hl and
AArch64 variants of the ARM architecture.[10][11]
